## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Woobly cursor on Wayland (#5)**: two-part fix.
  1. Virtual mouse now declares `INPUT_PROP_POINTER` via `UI_SET_PROPBIT`
     so libinput stops misclassifying the device. Regression test in
     `uinput_test.go` reads `/sys/class/input/inputN/properties` to verify
     the bit stays set.
  2. Ship `packaging/99-mwb-libinput.rules` udev rule that tags the
     `mwb-mouse` device with `LIBINPUT_ACCEL_PROFILE=flat` and
     `LIBINPUT_ACCEL_SPEED=0`. Reporter's `libinput debug-events` showed
     network-driven packet bursts produce variable input deltas (5–11×
     variance per axis); libinput's default adaptive accel curve was
     amplifying that variance into visible wobble. Flat profile maps
     deltas linearly so jitter is no longer multiplied. X11 path was
     unaffected throughout because XTest bypasses libinput.

### Added
- X-button support (back/forward): `BTN_SIDE`/`BTN_EXTRA` registered on virtual
  mouse, `WM_XBUTTONDOWN`/`WM_XBUTTONUP` handled in input handler.
- Horizontal scroll: `REL_HWHEEL` registered, `WM_MOUSEHWHEEL` handled —
  two-finger horizontal swipe from Windows trackpad now works on Ubuntu.
- 15 regression tests in `internal/capture/` covering xinput state management,
  mutex invariants, edge gate logic, and floating slave filtering.
- PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) with build, race, lint, and
  xinput safety checklists.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: documented 5 critical invariants with code examples
  and test references to prevent recurrence of known bug classes.

### Fixed
- **`SendPacket` data race**: `cipher.CBCEncrypter` is not goroutine-safe —
  concurrent calls from heartbeat, clipboard, and capture goroutines corrupted
  the AES stream. Added `sendMu sync.Mutex` to `Conn` serializing all writes.
- **Mouse button clicks at wrong position**: button events sent `X=0,Y=0` to
  Windows, registering every click at top-left. Now uses virtual cursor
  `remoteX/remoteY` state for correct click position.
- **`cfg.RemoteWidth/Height` ignored**: config values were parsed but never
  passed to `Capturer`, causing wrong virtual cursor mapping on non-1080p
  Windows displays and premature return-edge trigger.
- **`cfg.Edge` ignored**: `--edge` flag defaulted to `right`, silently
  overriding `edge = "left"` in `config.toml`. Now reads config if flag not set.
- **Deadlock after first edge switch**: `SetActive()` held `c.mu` and called
  `enableXinput()` which also acquires `c.mu` — Go mutexes are not reentrant.
  All goroutines waiting on `c.mu` froze permanently. Fixed by releasing lock
  before calling `enableXinput`.
- **Mouse/keyboard dead after `MachineSwitched`**: `OnActivated` callback did
  not move cursor away from the edge. Cursor stayed at `x=0`, any movement
  immediately re-triggered the edge switch. Added `xdotool mousemove` via
  `SafeEntryPosition()`, mirroring `OnReclaimed`.
- **Xinput floating slave corruption**: `enableXinput()` called unconditionally
  in `New()` and `Stop()` — calling `xinput enable` on `[floating slave]`
  devices corrupts attachment state, requiring manual `reattach`. Fixed: only
  call when `disabledXinputIDs` is non-empty.
- **Devices left disabled across sessions**: `enableXinput()` now merges cached
  IDs with a fresh scan to recover attached-but-disabled devices from prior
  broken sessions (e.g. connection drop mid-switch).
- **`monitorDevice` goroutine accumulation**: goroutines blocked on `f.Read()`
  indefinitely after `Stop()`. Fixed: track device fds in `Capturer`,
  close them in `Stop()`, wait on `WaitGroup`.
- **`sendText`/`sendImage` goroutines untracked**: clipboard send goroutines
  outlived the connection and wrote to closed conn. Tracked in `Manager.wg`.
- **Image clipboard echo-back**: `handleImageClipboard` set `justSet` but not
  `lastHash` — same image re-sent to Windows after 3s suppress window expired.
- **`parseXinputIDs` extracted** from `getXinputIDs` for testability; the
  critical `[floating slave]` filter is now covered by a regression test.
- **`uinput` keyboard init**: reduced from 767 ioctl calls to ~120 by only
  registering key codes present in the VK→evdev keymap.
- **Packet ID wraparound**: `nextID` now resets before reaching `0x7FFFFFFF`
  to avoid negative IDs violating protocol dedup requirements.

### Changed
- CI: opt into Node.js 24 for GitHub Actions ahead of June 2026 forced migration.
- `Stop()` only calls `enableXinput()` when `disabledXinputIDs` is non-empty.
- `New()` no longer calls `enableXinput()` unconditionally.
- `parseXinputIDs` is now a standalone testable function separate from the
  `xinput` subprocess call.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Bidirectional bounce-back**: Mouse no longer instantly snaps back to Ubuntu
  after crossing to the Windows screen. Virtual cursor now starts 200px inside
  the remote screen instead of at the exact return-edge threshold. Added
  `canReturn` gate — mirrors the existing `canSwitch` guard on the local side —
  requiring the cursor to move away from the return edge before switch-back can
  fire.
- **`canReturn` not reset on reconnect**: `SetActive(true)` now resets both
  `canSwitch` and `canReturn`, preventing ghost bounce-back from stale state
  after a disconnect/reconnect cycle.
- **DISPLAY/XAUTHORITY hardcoding**: Systemd service no longer requires a
  hardcoded `DISPLAY=` value. The binary auto-detects the active X11 display via
  `loginctl` session query, with `/tmp/.X11-unix` socket scan as fallback.
  XAUTHORITY is also auto-detected from `/run/user/*/gdm/`. Fixes edge detection
  silently failing after reboots or GDM updates where the display number shifts.
- **Screen resolution**: Correctly detected (e.g. 2560×1440 instead of 1920×1080
  fallback) because `DISPLAY` is now propagated to the process environment before
  `xrandr` runs.
- **Race conditions**: `cachedDisplay` package-level var guarded with `sync.Once`
  — `DetectDisplay()` is safe to call from concurrent goroutines. Hotkey state
  (`hotkeyCtrl`/`hotkeyAlt`) moved from package-level vars into `Capturer` struct.
  Key material cache in `network/client.go` guarded with `sync.Mutex`.

### Changed
- `packaging/mwb.service` synced with root `mwb.service`: correct binary path
  (`/usr/local/bin/mwb`), bidirectional flags, display auto-detection comments.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Dual-mode connection**: mwb now listens for incoming connections from Windows
  AND simultaneously tries outbound connect — first one wins. Enables instant
  reconnect after Windows lock/unlock cycles instead of waiting ~16s for Windows
  to start listening again.
- **Proactive heartbeats**: Send `HeartbeatEx` every 5s to prevent Windows MWB
  from silently dropping the connection.
- **TCP keep-alive**: 10s interval prevents NAT/firewall timeouts on idle
  connections.
- **Faster reconnect**: Backoff reduced from 1s–30s to 100ms–10s.

### Changed
- **Instant edge switching**: Replaced the 2s debounce timer with a `canSwitch`
  gate — switch fires the moment the cursor hits the edge, not after a delay.
- **Y-position matching**: Cursor enters the remote screen at a proportionally
  matched Y coordinate instead of screen center.
- **Correct entry edge**: Cursor enters from the right edge of Windows when
  coming from the left edge of Ubuntu (was entering from center).
- **Mouse acceleration**: 2× multiplier applied to evdev deltas for natural
  remote cursor movement speed.
- **Polling rate**: Increased from 50ms to 10ms for more responsive edge
  detection.
- **Grace period**: Reduced from 500ms to 100ms for faster transitions.
- **PBKDF2 key derivation cached** across reconnects (50k iterations is
  expensive — now only runs once per security key).

### Fixed
- Freeze on return: synchronous `xinput disable/enable` + cursor reposition
  prevents Ubuntu cursor from moving during Windows control.
- Edge trigger zone widened to 5px for more reliable activation.
- CI lint errors resolved; macOS removed from test matrix (Linux-only project).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Initial public release: native Linux client for Microsoft PowerToys Mouse
  Without Borders.
- Bidirectional mouse, keyboard, and clipboard sharing between Linux and Windows.
- AES-256-CBC encrypted protocol, fully compatible with PowerToys MWB.
- Device isolation via `xinput disable/enable` to prevent local cursor movement
  while controlling Windows.
- Text and image clipboard sync both directions via `xclip`/`xsel`.
- Ctrl+Alt+Right hotkey to force-return to Ubuntu if stuck.
- Systemd user service with auto-restart.
- `scripts/install.sh` one-command installer.
- GitHub Actions CI/CD: automated test, lint, and `.deb` release pipeline.
